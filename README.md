Hello there! (^o^)/ i am the developer of this app. What's my name? hmm... well it's kinda complicated to pronounce but here ∆×••⟨[]⟩ this is my name. It's hard right? hehe... why did i selected an alien, incomprehensible name like this? Cause it's cool!! ain't i right? In human language you can just call me Symbol. Is that fine enough? I think for now i will go with that. So anyway as i was saying i am the developer of this app and i think it's my responsibility to explain somethings about the app right? First it's an android launcher app or a custom home screen replacement app whatever you call it. And i would like to point out that the app follows very peculiar design compared to other apps out there. If you want to try out then sure go ahead i will also leave the play store link at the end of the file however i cannot guarantee that this app will suite your taste cause everyone is different after all right! The app is free hahaa well it's on github afterall so that should be obvious. The app doesn't have any kind of ads, in - app purchases or whatnot so you can use the app as freely as you can. Why? didn't i put any ads or anything? well there isn't any kind of grand reason or anything it's just that i don't like those things either and i think keeping the app clean would be much better won't you agree? Also cause wait!! did i mention that this is my first app? Oh god i totally forgot huh. So yeah this is my first app and i wanted to keep things clean that's why. Either way now that you are here already why don't you try out the app. And if you encountered any problem while using the app you can let me know here on the github or on my gmail. I will look  into it. So i guess that's all for now (> <) It's a bit sad but i hope we will meet again later in this or some other project of mine. Bye then :)
