## What's SimpliC?

So you wanna know what's simplic? Well it's not somethings grand like a big brand or anything hehe cough*. Just think of it as some thing like the name of a website or just a project's parent folder. I hope it makes things a bit clear.

## About the developer...( ∆×••⟨[]⟩ )

So you are here finally! **(^o^)/** let's start. As you can tell i am the developer of this app. What's my name? hmm... well it's kinda complicated to pronounce but here **∆×••⟨[]⟩** this is my name. It's hard right? hehe... why did i selected an alien, incomprehensible name like this? Cause it sounds so cool!! ain't i right? In human language you can just call me **Symbol**. Is that fine enough? I think for now i will go with that. So anyway as i was saying i am the developer of this app and i think it's my responsibility to explain somethings about the app right? First it's an android launcher app or a custom home screen replacement app whatever you call it. And i would like to point out that the app follows very peculiar design compared to other apps out there. If you want to try out then sure go ahead i will also leave the play store link at the end of the introduction however i cannot guarantee that this app will suite your taste cause everyone is different after all right! The app is free hahaa well it's on github afterall so that should be obvious. The app doesn't have any kind of ads, in - app purchases or whatnot so you can use the app as freely as you can. Why? didn't i put any ads or anything? well there isn't any kind of grand reason or anything it's just that i don't like those things either and i think keeping the app clean would be much better won't you agree? Also cause wait!! did i mention that this is my first app? Oh god i totally forgot huh. So yeah this is my first app and i wanted to keep things clean that's why. Either way now that you are here already why don't you try out the app. And if you encountered any problem while using the app you can let me know here on the github or on my gmail. I will look  into it. So i guess that's all for now (> <) It's a bit sad but i hope we will meet again later in this or some other project of mine. Bye then :)

## About the app...

>**Unique** *( Annoying to code )*----------**Simple** *( Easily understandable )*----------**Compact** *( Stylish i guess )*

Yup! the banner says it all. Fozin launcher, even though it follows a **unique** user interface **i** tried to make it as **simple** and **compact** as possible. The app still lacks a lot of funtionalities compared to other matured launcher apps out there and i know some may ask that why i haven't added this or that feature i don't have a good answer to that question cause the thing is i am still in the learning phase and i am still figuring things out so i really hope you will understand my reasons of why i made the app the way it is. Anyway with all that said and done why don't i tell you about what this app can really do...

## Features of the app...( Version 0.0.F.S )

1. You can take the backup of the .apk file of any installed app. Something like an in - built app & backup fetaure. Conveninent right :)

2. There are two types of widgets you will find in the app - Installed widgets on the device & **SimpliC's** in - built widgets. What's the difference well    why don't you see for yourself. hehe

3. You can customize **various** *( not to many though )* things like drawer app's list style, fozin's color themes, fon'ts style ets.

4. Just like widget's there are two modes of fonts present in the app - SimpliC's mode & Normal mode. NOTE - font's mode is different from font's style.

5. Fozin handles the wallpaper a bit differently it's a bit complicated to explain but i am sure you will be able to figure it out quite easily.

6. Fozin does't uses any **animations** *( yes it's a fetaure )*. How? and why?. I believe animations to be resource hungry which can slow down the app on    lower end devices. Not every one has 8 gb ram device afterall.

7. Well i don't think if it's a feature or not but fozin is very small in size maybe around 5 - 10 mb.

Now now don't judge too soon. I know at this moment the list doesn't looks too appealing however i am **sure** *( reality - 75% hope )* that the list will become quite big as the time passes by.

## Wanna know more about Fozin? Sure! here you go...
