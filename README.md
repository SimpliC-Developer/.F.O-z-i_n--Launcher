## •/]> What's SimpliC?

So you wanna know what's simplic? Well it's not somethings grand like a big brand or anything hehe cough*. Just think of it as some thing like the name of a website or just a project's parent folder. But why a name?. Convenience i guess. I think it will be much more convenient for me to release my projects under one name rather then releasing them under my **alien** like sounding name ( chuckles* ). I hope it makes things a bit clear.

## •/]> About the developer...( ∆×••⟨[]⟩ )

So you are here finally! **(^o^)/** let's start. As you can tell i am the developer of this app. What's my name? hmm... well it's kinda complicated to pronounce but here **∆×••⟨[]⟩** this is my name. It's hard right? hehe... why did i selected an alien, incomprehensible name like this? Cause it sounds so cool!! ain't i right? In human language you can just call me **Simplic's Developer**. Is that fine enough? I think for now i will go with that. So anyway as i was saying i am the developer of this app and i think it's my responsibility to explain somethings about the app right? First it's an android launcher app or a custom home screen replacement app whatever you call it. And i would like to point out that the app follows very peculiar design compared to other apps out there. If you want to try out then sure go ahead however i cannot guarantee that this app will suite your taste cause everyone is different after all right!. My **Fozin** is completly free! hahaa well it's on github afterall so that should be obvious. The app doesn't have any kind of ads, in - app purchases or whatnot so you can use the app as freely as you can. Why? didn't i put any ads or anything? well there isn't any kind of grand reason or anything it's just that i don't like those things either and i think keeping the app clean would be much better won't you agree? Also cause wait!! did i mention that this is my first app? Oh god i totally forgot huh?. So yeah this is my first app and i wanted to keep things clean that's why. Either way now that you are here already why don't you try out the app. And if you encountered any problem while using the app you can let me know here on the github or on my gmail. I will look into it. I guess that's all for now (> <), it's a bit sad i would have loved to talk more but i won't take your time any longer. So for now why don't you read ahead and know about fozin in much more details :) ...

## •/]> About the app...

>**Unique** *( Annoying to code )*----------**Simple** *( Easily understandable truly made for monkeys )*----------**Compact** *( Stylish i guess )*

Yup! the banner says it all. Fozin launcher, even though it follows a **unique** user interface **i** tried to make it as **simple** and **compact** as possible. The app still lacks a lot of funtionalities compared to other matured launcher apps out there and i know some may ask that why i haven't added this or that feature. I don't have a good answer to that question cause the thing is i am still in the learning phase and i am still figuring things out so i really hope you will understand my reasons of why i made the app the way it is. Anyway with all that said and done why don't i tell you about what this app can really do...

## •/]> Features of the app...( Version 0.0.F.S )

1. You can take the backup of the .apk file of any installed app. Something like an in - built app & backup fetaure. Convenient right :)

2. There are two types of widgets you will find in the app - Installed widgets on the device & **SimpliC's** in - built widgets. What's the difference well    why don't you see for yourself. hehe

3. You can customize **various** *( not to many though )* things like drawer app's list style, fozin's color themes, fon'ts style ets.

4. Just like widget's there are two modes of fonts present in the app - SimpliC's mode & Normal mode. NOTE - font's mode is different from font's style.

5. Fozin handles the wallpaper a bit differently it's a bit complicated to explain but i am sure you will be able to figure it out quite easily.

6. Fozin does't uses any **animations** *( yes it's a fetaure )*. How? and why?. I believe animations to be resource hungry which can slow down the app on    lower end devices. Not every one has 8 gb ram device afterall.

7. SimpliC uses something called status it's basically what it sounds like. Status shows you some details about the device eg - battery, wifi etc. NOTE -      Status is different from the widgets;

8. Well i don't think if it's a feature or not but fozin is very small in size maybe around 5 - 10 mb.

Now now don't judge too soon. I know at this moment the list doesn't looks too appealing however i am **sure** *( reality - 75% hope )* that the list will become quite big as the time passes by.

## •/]> Wanna know more about Fozin? Sure! here you go...

- **Version - 0.0.F.S**  *( F means Fozin & S means SimpliC )*
- **Codename - The Nest**  *( Based after a comfy bird's nest )*
- **Maintainer - ∆×••⟨[]⟩**  *( Runaway alien from area 51 )*
- **Developers - SimpliC**  *( My current alias... YEAH! pfft! )*
- **Minimum android version - 5.1 Lollipop**  *( Yup! it really won't work below this )*
- **Maximum android version - 11**  *( Again won't work if the android is above 11 )*
- **App size - 5 mb**  *( May change in future )*
- **Permissions needed - STOREAGE Read / Write**  *( Not necessary to grant if you just want to use the app but some fetaures would become unavailable )*

## •/]> About the source...

Okay! as you can see **Fozin** is an open - source project. In other words if you want you can download the source code and make you own version of the app. How to do it? well you can just clone the repo using \"git clone https://github.com/SimpliC-Developer/.F.O-z-i_n--Launcher -b 0.0.F.S\" or just download the **\"Fozin Source.zip\"** from the releases page. Then you are good to go. However please don't forget to include the **LICENSE** file in your custom version of **Fozin**. Why? cause the app uses GPL 3.0 license. Which means in case you decide to **redistribute** the app you will have to include the license otherwise things might become a bit messy. The app doesn't needs any special development environment. You can just use android studio or intellij idea or whatever suits your preferences for it. Happy coding!

## •/]> About contributing, pull - request etc...

Lets leave that on fate :)

## •/]> How to build?...

Even though i said you don't need any special development environment to build your version of **Fozin** there are somethings which you will have to modify in the project to actually make it work. Don't worry it's not that big of a deal just follow me closely...

1. local.properties file is missing so you will have to add your own before you can proceed with the build. Those who don't know what is this file, basically it contains things like sdk path etc.

2. I have removed my own configurations from build.gradle file things like - keystore info. So in case you want to sign the app with your own keys you can do that by adding that in this file.

And Done!! see it's not that big and complicated right.

## •/]> Something about fragmentation....

Oh! right there is one thing i forgot to mention. The version of the **Fozin** which you will find here in the releases section will be a bit and i mean a very small bit different compared to the one which, when you will download and build on your own system. It's not that different rest assured the source you are seeing here is the exact copy of the source on my system. However i still think that fragmentation will be unavoidable. So please keep this in mind.

## •/]> A bit of your help...( pwease )

Now then what do you think? Wanna give **Fozin** a try? Hehe oh well i won't pester you okay. However in case you do decide to try out the app there is something i might need your help with. And no i am not talking about weird things like donations, coffee cup or whatnot. The thing is as i have mentioned before from time to time i work alone as an indie dev *( alright fine! just started )*. So because of that and because of **Fozin's** blessed **ui** it's a headache to keep the track of bugs. I did try to make sure there are as less bugs as possible however let's be real there is noting called a bug free or a hack proof software *( app in this case )*. My point is you may encounter some bugs which i might not be aware of and as i have said before *( 1st paragraph )* i would really appreciate it if you can provide me with a bit of your assistance on that part. How? well you can tell me about it here on github or on my gamil. What? pfft well obviously about the **bug**. But please be elegant about how you tell me that. In case you want pointers here's a small template....

- **Device Name -** *( model name + brand name )*
- **Android Version -** *( your current android version )*
- **Bug Encountered -** *( try to keep it short. eg - drawer crashed when i pressed on refresh button )*
- **Message -** *( if you want to say something you can say it here )* 

NOTE - If you can attach the logcat file than it would help me much more *( around 90% )* then simply telling me about the bug in the message. Currently **Fozin** cannot take the logcat on it's own so you will have to use other apps or much better a pc to do it. How? u-um for that you can just search on the internet.

NOTE - If you are new to github *( like me )* then you should start a new **issue**. Please refer to github docs or just search on internet about it and you will find your answers.

## •/]>  Closing Words...

Phew time sure passes by fast huh! Now that you have reached here i don't think there is anything else left to tell you about either the **Fozin** app or me. You can find my gmail account down below so in - case you want to reach out to me you can also use that as an alternative. This time it's really a good bye. So take care until next time :)
