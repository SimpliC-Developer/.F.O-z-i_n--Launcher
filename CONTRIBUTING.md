•/]> About the guidelines...

There really isn't any special guideline which you have to follow however it would be easier for me if you can keep things clean

•/]> So how toC ontribute?...

Here these are steps which you should follow...

1. clone the repo using git clone or donwload the .zip source format.
2. make whatever changes you want to in your local repo clone.
3. when you are done open the pull - request from the repository's tab.

There you go it's small and simple right? :)

•/]> Why so small?...

well to tell you the truth i am still new to github and it might take me a bit of time to get the hang of it i hope you will understand.
